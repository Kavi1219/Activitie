HTTP 1.1 vs HTTP 2

// HTTP/1.1 loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded
 it blocks all the other resources behind it. 
 In contrast, HTTP/2 is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at 
 once so that no one resource blocks any other resource.
  HTTP/2 does this by splitting data into binary-code messages and numbering these messages
   so that the client knows which stream each binary message belongs to.//

//Typically, a server only serves content to a client device if the client asks for it. 
However, this approach is not always practical for modern webpages, which often involve several dozen separate resources that the client must request.
 The server also sends a message letting the client know what pushed content to expect 
 like if Bob had sent Alice a Table of Contents of his novel before sending the whole thing.//

 // Small files load more quickly than large ones. 
 To speed up web performance, both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 compress HTTP messages to make them smaller.
  However, HTTP/2 uses a more advanced compression method called HPACK that eliminates redundant information in HTTP header packets.
   This eliminates a few bytes from every HTTP packet.
  Given the volume of HTTP packets involved in loading even a single webpage, those bytes add up quickly, resulting in faster loading.//
