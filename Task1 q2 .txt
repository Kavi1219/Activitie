Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript


// A JavaScript object is a collection of named values having state and behavior (properties and method)”.
        
 Take the case of car as example

All cars have the same properties, but the property values differ from car to car. 
All cars have the same methods, but the methods are performed at different times.//

//Objects:

The following code assigns a simple value (Mercedes) to a variable named car:
    var car = 'mercedes';
Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values.


var car = {Make: “Mercedes”, Model: “C-Class”, Color: “White”, Fuel: Diesel, Weight: “850kg”, Mileage: “8Kmpl”, Rating: 4.5};
 
 The above code contains many values , here the variable name and the valuses are  separated  bya a " : "

 JavaScript objects are containers for named values //


//properties:

The name:values pairs are called properties
The object properties can be different primitive values, other objects and functions.
Properties can usually be changed, added, and deleted, but some are read only.

The syntax for adding a property to an object is :
         ObjectName.ObjectProperty = propertyValue;

The syntax for deleting a property from an object is:
         delete ObjectName.ObjectProperty;

The syntax to access a property from an object is:

objectName.property  OR  objectName["property”]    OR   objectName[expression]
 
 Properties are the values associated with a JavaScript object.//


//Methods

An object method is an object property containing a function definition.

i.e.

Let’s assume to start the car there will be a mechanical functionality.

         function(){return ignition.on}

and so similar is to stop/brake/headlights on & off, etc.

Methods are actions that can be performed on objects.//
